## Getting Started

Install Web3 Client:

- Metamask Chrome Extension (https://metamask.io/)
- Parity Chrome Extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/parity-ethereum-integrati/himekenlppkgeaoeddcliojfddemadig)

We recommend Metamask as they provide a fully synced Ethereum node. Parity requires you to sync a node and can take a few hours to a few days.


## Using the Dapp

EscrowMyEther has 3 seperate dashboards for buyers, sellers and escrow agents.
